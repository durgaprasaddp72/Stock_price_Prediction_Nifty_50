# Stock_price_Prediction_Nifty_50
This project focuses on predicting stock prices of the Nifty 50 Index using machine learning and deep learning models.
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to forecast future stock trends.

Workflow
1.Data Loading – Import historical Nifty 50 stock price data.
2.Preprocessing – Clean, normalize, and create features such as moving averages, returns, and technical indicators.
3.Model Building – Implement ML/DL models (e.g., LSTM, RNN, or Regression) for time-series forecasting.
4.Training – Train the model with suitable loss functions and optimizers.
5.Evaluation – Assess model accuracy using metrics like RMSE and visualize predictions vs. actual prices.
6.Visualization – Plot stock price trends, training curves, and predicted future values.
